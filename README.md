In this Project, our main task is to Create a Parking management system with available options like :

1. Booking minimum slots of 50.
2. There after, increase slots on the count of 10 if more slots ae required.
3. If a slot is available for free, Book that slot and take details{Name, Contact} of that person.
4. Free up the slot
5. If there is no specific slot mentioned, we need to allocate slots in a numerical order

# Other features are :

6. Calculate the time between assignment of slot and freeing up
7. When freeing up, show a charge which is calculated as INR.1/minute.
8. Deploying app on Heroku.
   Link to the web-app :

# Steps during the project :

1. I made a plan of everything
2. I took 50 slots and created a menu for it:
   It has two options: 1. Book a slot if available 2. Free up the slot if already booked.
3. During assignment , I made a pop-up which can take the details of the person booking the slot.
   During Freeing up, based on time difference between Slot assignment and Freeing up, I displayed a charge in a pop-up the person has to pay.

4. There is a "Add More" option which can be used if the user wants to increase the number of slots.

**Note: Elements like cards and buttons are bootstrapped.**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
